                                    <p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic">Amaan Modak moved to Buffalo, New York from Mumbai in India. Completed his education from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he obtained his Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. He is looking for a job in the fast-paced and developing field of Software Engineering. Being passionate about computers and software development, the choice of computer science as a future career was only natural. In his free time, he loves to read books, and go hiking with his friends. Amaan is also a part of a soccer club, and loves participating in and promoting local soccer tournaments. Before moving to Buffalo, Amaan worked in Praxis Interactive Solutions in Mumbai as a Consultant Instructional Writer. With encouragement from friends and family, Amaan jumped ship and moved to the United States, the land of opportunity. It is here that he hopes to make a name for himself, and make a positive difference to the world and give back to society.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">During a conversation with a professor at my university, my professor asked me: “Tell me what made you decide to be a computer science engineer!” And thanks to all my experiences from my past, I actually had a coherent answer to his question. I said: “It all began when I was an 8 year old and my father bought us our first computer. In those days, the only thing kids my age did on a computer was use Paint. Even both my elder brothers only used it for the occassional school work and document editing. However, I was fascinated with it. I spent hours on it, not just drawing and painting, but playing games, learning new thing, and even trying to understand how it all worked. Now 15 years down the line that passion to learn more about this exciting innovation called a computer has only grown more and more. I am in awe of how far the world has come in that period and can only imagine where the world will be heading in the future. I would love to be a part of that future and make a contribution which will significantly better the lives of the people all over the world.”</p>
